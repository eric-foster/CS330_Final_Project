# CS330_Final_Project
## How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by first breaking the problem down into smaller, manageable parts and clearly identifying the requirements. For this project, I thought carefully about how the scene should look and function before writing any code, considering what objects to include, how the user would interact with the camera, and what textures and lighting would best support realism. This structured approach allowed me to align the technical implementation with the intended user experience.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on this project helped me strengthen my ability to design with modularity and reusability in mind. I learned to separate concerns, such as using a ViewManager for camera control and ShapeMeshes for texture application, which made the project more organized. I also gained skills in balancing aesthetics with technical constraints, like ensuring the textures and lighting choices supported both visual appeal and performance.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process I followed was iterative and layered, starting with a conceptual sketch of the 3D scene, then planning the classes and functions that would bring it to life. I moved from high-level design, thinking about what the user should see and do, into detailed design decisions such as how textures would be sampled or how lighting would enhance objects. Each milestone allowed me to refine the design further while keeping the overall project vision in mind.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tactics I used in this project, such as modular design, planning around user interaction, and refining features through iteration, can be applied in any future software development work. They allow me to break down complex problems, manage scope effectively, and build solutions that are flexible and adaptable. These habits are especially valuable in larger projects where scalability and maintainability are crucial.

## How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by writing code in small, testable steps and integrating new features gradually. This method ensures that I can identify and fix errors early before they affect larger parts of the program. I also prioritize readability and structure, using functions and classes to make the code easier to maintain and extend.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
In this project, I used new development strategies such as working directly with OpenGL shaders and managing the rendering pipeline. I also applied techniques like texture sampling, mipmapping, and lighting calculations to create a realistic scene. Learning to use iterative builds and debugging graphical output was especially helpful for identifying mistakes in transformations, textures, or lighting setups.

## How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was central to my development process, as I frequently built small parts of the project, tested them, and then refined them. For example, I started with basic object rendering, then added textures, and finally introduced lighting and camera controls. This step-by-step refinement not only improved the quality of the final scene but also helped me learn from mistakes along the way.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
My approach evolved from simply trying to make things work into writing code that was modular, reusable, and better structured. Early on, I focused on functionality, but as the project progressed, I learned the importance of planning my classes and functions to keep the codebase clean and maintainable. This growth in coding discipline ultimately made the final project more polished and easier to manage.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides the foundation I need to achieve my career and academic goals by equipping me with problem-solving skills, technical expertise, and the ability to design efficient systems. The logical and systematic thinking I’ve developed in this course will help me excel in both professional projects and future studies, especially in areas like software engineering and artificial intelligence.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations have taught me how math, programming, and design come together to create meaningful digital experiences. These skills will support me in advanced computer science coursework by giving me a strong foundation in areas like 3D modeling, simulations, and human-computer interaction. They also improve my ability to think critically about how visual systems are designed and implemented.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Professionally, computational graphics and visualizations give me tools to solve real-world problems where data needs to be represented visually, such as simulations, data visualization, and interactive applications. Understanding the rendering pipeline, shaders, and scene design allows me to contribute to industries ranging from software engineering to game development and even AI-driven visualization tools. These skills strengthen my ability to create software that is both functional and engaging.
